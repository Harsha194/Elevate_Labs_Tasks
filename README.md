# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing - Titanic Dataset
This project demonstrates basic data cleaning and preprocessing for machine learning using the Titanic dataset.
# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Titanic Dataset)

## What is Data Preprocessing?
Data preprocessing means turning messy, raw data into clean, organized data that a machine learning model can use.

## Steps Followed
1. **Imported the data** using Pandas.
2. **Explored the data** to understand its structure and missing values.
3. **Handled missing values** by filling in with median (for Age) and mode (for Embarked), and dropped the Cabin column.
4. **Encoded categorical variables** (Sex, Embarked) using one-hot encoding.
5. **Standardized numerical features** (Age, Fare) so they have mean 0 and std 1.
6. **Visualized and removed outliers** in Fare using boxplots and IQR method.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

- Cleaning and transforming the data helps the model learn better and make more accurate predictions.

*****TASK-2*****

What is EDA?
EDA is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.

Steps Followed
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Explored basic statistics (mean, median, std, min, max).

Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots.

Analyzed relationships between features using pairplots and correlation matrices.

Detected anomalies (outliers, missing values, skewed distributions).

Drew basic inferences about feature importance and data quality.

Tools Used
Python

Pandas (Data manipulation)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualizations)

NumPy (Numerical computations)

Key Outputs
‚úÖ Summary Statistics ‚Äì Mean, median, and spread of numerical features (Age, Fare, etc.).
üìä Histograms & Boxplots ‚Äì Visualized distributions and outliers in numeric columns.
üîó Correlation Matrix ‚Äì Identified relationships between features (e.g., Pclass vs. Survival).
‚ö†Ô∏è Outlier Detection ‚Äì Flagged extreme values (e.g., very high Fare values).
üìù Basic Inferences ‚Äì Noted skewness, missing data, and potential preprocessing steps.

Why EDA Matters
Helps identify data issues (missing values, outliers).

Guides feature engineering (which columns need scaling, encoding, etc.).

Improves model performance by ensuring clean, well-understood data.

- Cleaning and transforming the data helps the model learn better and make more accurate predictions.
