# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing - Titanic Dataset
This project demonstrates basic data cleaning and preprocessing for machine learning using the Titanic dataset.
# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Titanic Dataset)

## What is Data Preprocessing?
Data preprocessing means turning messy, raw data into clean, organized data that a machine learning model can use.

## Steps Followed
1. **Imported the data** using Pandas.
2. **Explored the data** to understand its structure and missing values.
3. **Handled missing values** by filling in with median (for Age) and mode (for Embarked), and dropped the Cabin column.
4. **Encoded categorical variables** (Sex, Embarked) using one-hot encoding.
5. **Standardized numerical features** (Age, Fare) so they have mean 0 and std 1.
6. **Visualized and removed outliers** in Fare using boxplots and IQR method.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

- Cleaning and transforming the data helps the model learn better and make more accurate predictions.
